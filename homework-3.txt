3. Both Flexbox and CSS Grid are powerful layout systems for web design. 
   Flexbox is one-dimensional, organizing items in a single row or column.
   This makes it ideal for simple layouts, such as navigation bars or centering 
   content. CSS Grid, in contrast, is two-dimensional. This allows for layouts 
   with multiple rows and columns, making it better suited for complex, grid-based 
   designs. Flexbox is well-suited for linear, responsive layouts, while CSS Grid 
   offers more versatility for multi-dimensional designs. It is also worth noting 
   that flexbox is easier to use for straightforward layouts, whereas CSS Grid is
   more powerful for handling intricate, structured layouts.
